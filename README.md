## ðŸ’¡ Introduction

NVILA is a family of open VLMs designed to optimize both **efficiency** and **accuracy** for efficient **video understanding** and **multi-image understanding** . Building on top of VILA, we improve its model architecture by first scaling up the spatial and temporal resolutions, and then compressing visual tokens. This "scale-then-compress" approach enables NVILA to efficiently process high-resolution images and long videos. We also conduct a systematic investigation to enhance the efficiency of NVILA throughout its entire lifecycle, from training and fine-tuning to deployment. NVILA matches or surpasses the accuracy of many leading open and proprietary VLMs across a wide range of image and video benchmarks. At the same time, it reduces training costs by 4.5Ã—, fine-tuning memory usage by 3.4Ã—, pre-filling latency by 1.6-2.2Ã—, and decoding latency by 1.2-2.8Ã—. We make our code and models available to facilitate reproducibility.

### Video

https://github.com/Efficient-Large-Model/VILA/assets/156256291/c9520943-2478-4f97-bc95-121d625018a6

Prompt: Elaborate on the visual and narrative elements of the video in detail.

Response: The video features a person with red nail polish meticulously working on a piece of fabric with a black and white checkered pattern. The individual is dressed in a black top with a red inner layer. The setting includes a white table where various tools such as a ruler, a pencil, and a pin are placed. The person is seen folding the fabric in a precise manner, creating a triangular shape. The background includes a greenish cabinet with drawers, adding a contrasting color to the scene. Throughout the video, the text 'Country Sampler' is visible in the bottom right corner, indicating the source or brand associated with the content. The video emphasizes the careful and detailed process of fabric folding, showcasing the person's skill and attention to detail.

https://github.com/Efficient-Large-Model/VILA/assets/7783214/80c47742-e873-4080-ad7d-d17c4700539f

## Installation

```bash
./environment_setup.sh vila
```

## Training

VILA training contains three steps, for specific hyperparameters, please check out the [scripts/v1_5](scripts/v1_5) folder:

### Step-1: Alignment

We utilize LLaVA-CC3M-Pretrain-595K dataset to align the textual and visual modalities.

The stage 1 script takes in two parameters and it can run on a single 8xA100 node.

```bash
bash scripts/NVILA-Lite/align.sh Efficient-Large-Model/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct <alias to data>
```

and the trained models will be saved to `runs/train/nvila-8b-align`.

### Step-1.5:

```bash
bash scripts/NVILA-Lite/stage15.sh runs/train/nvila-8b-align/model <alias to data>
```

and the trained models will be saved to `runs/train/nvila-8b-align-1.5`.

### Step-2: Pretraining

We use MMC4 and Coyo dataset to train VLM with interleaved image-text pairs.

```bash
bash scripts/NVILA-Lite/pretrain.sh runs/train/nvila-8b-align-1.5 <alias to data>
```

and the trained models will be saved to `runs/train/nvila-8b-pretraining`.

### Step-3: Supervised fine-tuning

This is the last stage of VILA training, in which we tune the model to follow multimodal instructions on a subset of M3IT, FLAN and ShareGPT4V. This stage runs on a 8xA100 node.

```bash
bash scripts/NVILA-Lite/sft.sh runs/train/nvila-8b-pretraining <alias to data>
```

and the trained models will be saved to `runs/train/nvila-8b-SFT`.

## Evaluations

We have introduce `vila-eval` command to simplify the evaluation. Once the data is prepared, the evaluation can be launched via

```bash
MODEL_NAME=NVILA-15B
MODEL_ID=Efficient-Large-Model/$MODEL_NAME
huggingface-cli download $MODEL_ID

vila-eval \
    --model-name $MODEL_NAME \
    --model-path $MODEL_ID \
    --conv-mode auto \
    --tags-include local
```

it will launch all evaluations and return a summarized result.

## Inference

We provide `vila-infer` for quick inference with user prompts and images.

```bash
# image description
vila-infer \
    --model-path Efficient-Large-Model/NVILA-15B \
    --conv-mode auto \
    --text "Please describe the image" \
    --media inference_test/test_data/caption_meat.jpeg

# video description
vila-infer \
    --model-path Efficient-Large-Model/NVILA-15B \
    --conv-mode auto \
    --text "Please describe the video" \
    --media https://huggingface.co/datasets/Efficient-Large-Model/VILA-inference-demos/resolve/main/OAI-sora-tokyo-walk.mp4
```

<sup>NOTE: `vila-infer` is also compatible with VILA-1.5 models. You may find the usage example in [tests/bash/test_inference.sh](./tests/bash/test_inference.sh).</sup>

## Quantization and Deployment

Our VILA models are quantized by [AWQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978) into 4 bits for efficient inference on the edge. We provide a push-the-button [script](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/llm-awq/blob/main/scripts/vila_example.sh) to quantize VILA with AWQ.

### Running VILA on desktop GPUs and edge GPUs

We support AWQ-quantized 4bit VILA on GPU platforms via [TinyChat](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/llm-awq/tree/main/tinychat). We provide a [tutorial](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/llm-awq/tree/main/tinychat#support-vlm-models-vila--llava) to run the model with TinyChat after quantization. We also provide an [instruction](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/llm-awq/tree/main/tinychat/serve) to launch a Gradio server (powered by TinyChat and AWQ) to serve 4-bit quantized VILA models.

### Running VILA on laptops

We further support our AWQ-quantized 4bit VILA models on various CPU platforms with both x86 and ARM architectures with our [TinyChatEngine](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/TinyChatEngine). We also provide a detailed [tutorial](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/TinyChatEngine/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#deploy-vision-language-model-vlm-chatbot-with-tinychatengine) to help the users deploy VILA on different CPUs.

### Running VILA API server

A simple API server has been provided to serve VILA models. The server is built on top of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [Huggingface Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/). The server can be run with the following command:

#### With CLI

```bash
python -W ignore server.py \
    --port 8000 \
    --model-path Efficient-Large-Model/NVILA-15B \
    --conv-mode auto
```

#### With Docker

```bash
docker build -t vila-server:latest .
docker run --gpus all --ipc=host --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 \
    -v ./hub:/root/.cache/huggingface/hub \
    -it --rm -p 8000:8000 \
    -e VILA_MODEL_PATH=Efficient-Large-Model/NVILA-15B \
    -e VILA_CONV_MODE=auto \
    vila-server:latest
```

Then you can call the endpoint with the OpenAI SDK as follows:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000",
    api_key="fake-key",
)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "Whatâ€™s in this image?"},
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "https://blog.logomyway.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NVIDIA-logo.jpg",
                        # Or you can pass in a base64 encoded image
                        # "url": "data:image/png;base64,<base64_encoded_image>",
                    },
                },
            ],
        }
    ],
    model="NVILA-15B",
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

<sup>NOTE: This API server is intended for evaluation purposes only and has not been optimized for production use. SGLang support is coming on the way.</sup>
